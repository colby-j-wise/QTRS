# Project Description

This is a longer-term personal project who goal is to implement a low to medium frequency
quantitative systematic trading strategy portfolio. See the _Code Attribution_ section below
for sources for original code.  

## Code Attribution

Starter code originally referenced from _Successful Algorithmic Trading_ by Michael L. Halls-Moore.
It's an great introductory book and I recommend it as a first source for those like myself, curious
on how to begin to build an end-to-end algorithmic trading system.
From there customization and personalization added.

## Work in Progress

Everything... 

### Important

In it's inital state, the code-base is essentially just a rehash of code outline in the book. That said,
as I build upon it and customize it for my personal needs I plan to keep the bulk of the source code public.
"Bulk" meaning the majority of the infrastructure code such as the backtester, data system, and execution system.
Excluded from this will be the specific live strategy source code, but I expect to include basic examples later on.
